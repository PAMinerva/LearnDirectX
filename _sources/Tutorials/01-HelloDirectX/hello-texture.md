## Introduction

Up to this point, we have used per-vertex attributes to provide color information for our triangles rendered on the screen. This approach involves associating a color with each vertex of the triangle, allowing the rasterizer to interpolate colors for internal fragments. While this method offers a straightforward way to fill 3D primitives with colors, the visual effect may lack realism.

The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to enhance the level of detail and realism in our meshes by mapping 2D textures onto 3D geometries. To achieve this, we need to switch from setting colors per-vertex to setting colors per-fragment. The upcoming sections will guide you through the necessary steps to make this transition.

```{note}
Typically, textures are created by graphic artists and provided as assets for use in our graphics applications. However, for the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial we will manually create (i.e., programmatically generated in the source code) a basic texture that exhibits a checkerboard pattern.
```

Before delving into the code of the sample, it's crucial to grasp some fundamental theory behind texture mapping. Texture mapping is a technique that allows us to apply an image or pattern onto a 3D mesh, enhancing its visual appearance and adding fine-grained details. With texture mapping, we can achieve more realistic and visually appealing renderings.

Part of the theory illustrated in the following sections draws from the official Microsoft documentation. In particular, {cite}`IntroToTexturesD3D11` and {cite}`TexturesAddressingModeD3D9` are used as references.

## Textures

A texture is a resource that can be thought of as an array of contiguous texels (texture elements) stored in memory. Texels are the smallest units of a texture that can be read or written to. When a shader reads a texture, samplers can be used to filter accesses to the texels of the texture. Each texel contains 1 to 4 components (also called channels), arranged in one of the DXGI formats defined by the **DXGI_FORMAT** enumeration. For example, **DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM** specifies that every texel is a 32-bit value composed of four 8-bit unsigned-normalized-integer channels. This means that the value of each channel is in the range $[0/255, 255/255]=[0, 1]$; that is, each channel can represent 256 different values (that's the actual meaning of unsigned-normalized-integer).

```{note}
Textures are commonly created by graphic artists and supplied in JPEG or PNG format, which are two of the most widely used image file formats. However, to employ these files in DirectX applications, we need additional code or an external library (such as [DirectXTK12](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK12)) to transform the image data into a supported DXGI format before creating the actual texture resource. <br>
As an alternative, graphic artists or programmers can convert the image data into a supported DXGI format and store the (compressed or uncrompressed) result in a specialized container file. These container files, such as DDS (DirectDraw Surface), encapsulate the texture type and data, along with additional information like format, dimensions, and mipmap levels. This approach ensures optimal performance for runtime usage and supports a variety of texture resource types and formats (1D, 2D, volume maps, cubemaps, mipmap levels, texture arrays, cubemap arrays, block compressed formats, etc.). More details on texture containers will be provided in a later tutorial.

### 1D Textures

A 1D texture, in its simplest form, can be visualized as an array of contiguous texels in memory. In this case, the texture data can be addressed with a single coordinate (*s* in the image below).

```{figure} images/05/1d-tex.png
```

Adding more complexity, we can also create a 1D texture with mipmap levels, as shown in the following image.

```{figure} images/05/1d-tex-mips.png
```

Just think of it as a single resource that is made up of three subresources. Mipmaps play a crucial role in texture sampling and filtering by providing smaller versions of the original image. The highest level, known as level 0, include the original image and holds the finest level of detail. As we move down the hierarchy, each subsequent level contains a progressively smaller mipmap with reduced details.

For a 1D texture with mipmaps, the smallest level contains a mipmap composed of one texel. Mipmaps are generated by halving the size of the previous level, rounding up to the nearest even integer, until we get a mipmap of a single texel. For example, the illustration above shows a $5\times 1$ texture whose next lower mipmap is a $2\times 1$ texture, whose next (and last) mipmap is a $1\times 1$ sized texture.

To facilitate identification and retrieval of specific subresources during geometry rendering based on camera distance, each level is assigned an index, commonly referred to as LOD (level-of-detail). This LOD index serves as a useful tool for accessing the appropriate mipmap level when required.

#### 1D Texture arrays

Direct3D also supports arrays of textures. An array of 1D textures looks conceptually like the following illustration.

```{figure} images/05/1d-tex-array-mip.png
```

The above texture array contains three textures, each containing three mipmaps. So, you can also consider it as a single resource that is made up of nine subresources.

```{figure} images/05/1d-subresources.png
```

Typically, texture array include homogeneous elements. This means that all textures in the array must have the same format, size, and number of mipmap levels. The size of a texture array is set to the dimension of the topmost mipmap level. For example, the size of the texture array illustrated above is 5 because the topmost mipmap of each texture includes five texels.

### 2D Textures and 2D Texture arrays

A 2D Texture can be conceptually visualized as a 2D grid of texels — although it is physically stored as an array of contiguous texels, just like 1D textures. This grid-like (logical) arrangement facilitates addressing individual texels using two coordinates (*s* and *t* in the image below), enabling efficient access and manipulation of texels within the texture. Similar to 1D textures, 2D textures may contain mipmap levels. An example of 2D texture resource (with mipmaps) is illustrated in the following image.

```{figure} images/05/2d-tex.png
```

The texture above has a $3\times 5$ mipmap at the topmost level, along with two other smaller mipmaps at lower levels.

A 2D texture array resource is a homogeneous array of 2D textures; that is, each texture has the same data format and dimensions (including mipmap levels). It has a similar layout as the 1D texture array, except that the textures now contain 2D data, as shown in the following illustration.

```{figure} images/05/2d-tex-array.png
```

The array texture illustrated above contains three textures, each with a $3\times 5$ mipmap at the topmost level, and with two additional smaller mipmaps at lower levels. So, you can also consider it as a single resource made up of nine subresources.

```{note}
3D textures exist as well, but we'll leave the discussion of 3D textures for a subsequent tutorial.

##  Texel Coordinate System

The texel coordinate system has its origin at the top-left corner of the texture, as shown in the following diagram. Texel coordinates $(s,t)$ are typically continuous, but texels are usually located at integer locations (discrete coordinates). In this space, texel centers are offset by $(0.5, 0.5)$ (half-integer locations). Normalized coordinates in the following illustration below contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between the texel and texture coordinate systems (explained in more detail in the subsequent sections).

## Texture Coordinate System

As stated in the previous section, each texel in a texture can be specified by its integer texel coordinates. However, in order to map texels onto primitives, Direct3D requires a uniform address range. That is, it uses a generic addressing scheme in which each component of all texel addresses $(s,t)$ is normalized to be within the range $[0.0,\ 1.0]$.

```{figure} images/05/texture-coord.png
```

```{note}
Technically, Direct3D can actually process texture coordinates outside the range $[0, 1]$. The way it handles these coordinates depends on the parameters you set for texture addressing (more on this shortly).
```

With texture coordinates, we can address texels without knowing the size of a texture. For example, in the following illustration, we can select the central texel in the last row for two different textures by using the texture coordinates $(0.5, 1.0)$.

```{figure} images/05/texture-coord2.png
```

Applying a texture to a 3D primitive involves mapping texel coordinates to the vertices of the primitive. However, how can we map 2D texel coordinates to 3D positions? One way to do that is through a technique called UV mapping, which conceptually involves unwrapping the 3D mesh onto the unit square $[0,1]\times [0,1]$ that defines the texture coordinate system. This process is similar to unwrapping a Christmas chocolate on a table, as illustrated below.

```{figure} images/05/tex-unwrap.jpg
```

UV mapping allows vertex positions to be associated with texture coordinates within the unit square defined above. This ends up allowing us to determine which texel from the texture will be mapped to a specific vertex position. We'll demonstrate this soon with a straightforward example.

```{figure} images/05/texture2texel.png
```

Here, for the sake of semplicity, we will consider a single triangle that is mapped to take the whole unit square of texture coordinate system.

```{figure} images/05/triangle-unwrap.png
```

By associating (using vertex attributes in the definition of the corresponding vertex buffer) the texture coordinates $(0.5, 0)$, $(1, 1)$ and $(0, 1)$ respectively with the vertices $\mathbf{v}_1$, $\mathbf{v}_2$ and $\mathbf{v}_3$ of a triangle in 3D space, we establish a connection between vertex positions and texture coordinates. To obtain the integer texel coordinates that allow us to select a texel from the texture, we can multiply each component of the texture coordinates by the corresponding dimension of the texture, minus 1, and round the result by simply truncating the fractional part.

For example, if we have an $8\times 4$ texture, the vertex $\mathbf{v}_1$ in the figure above would be paired with the integer texel coordinates $\big(⌊(0.5∗(8-1))⌋,\ ⌊(0.0∗(4-1))⌋\big)=(3,0)$. This way, we associated the vertex position $\mathbf{v}_1$ with the fourth texel of the first row of the texture. The same goes for the vertices $\mathbf{v}_2$ and $\mathbf{v}_3$, which would be associated respectively with the last and first texels of the last row. Eventually, we established a connection between vertices and texels.

This association between vertices and texels allows us to enhance the level of detail and realism in our rendering. How? Well, first of all, it should be noted that associating vertices with texels practically means that we must declare the texture coordinates as a vertex attribute to associate them with vertex positions in 3D space. When the rasterizer interpolates the texture coordinates of a pixel, we can use the result in the shader code to select a texel from a texture as the per-pixel color (more on this shortly). This means that instead of having an interpolated color for each pixel within a primitive, we now have a color selected from a texture that represents a real material. This allows us to select a color per-pixel rather than per-vertex, leading to an higher level of detail and realism.
