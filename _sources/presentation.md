# Welcome to Learn DirectX

This tutorial series will walk you through using the latest DirectX graphics API to create C++ graphics applications from scratch, both for Windows and Linux. Each tutorial will present a small sample to illustrate specific theoretical concepts and their practical implementation.

Designed for beginners with no prior knowledge of computer graphics or advanced mathematics, this tutorial series relies on basic C++ skills and requires only a fundamental understanding of high school math, including algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.

To compile and run the samples, you must first download the corresponding code, available on GitHub in two repositories: 

- <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples" target="_blank">DirectX-Graphics-Samples</a> 
- <a href="https://github.com/PAMinerva/LearnDirectX" target="_blank">LearnDirectX</a>
