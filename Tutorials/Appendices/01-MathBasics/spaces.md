# Spaces

The magic of computer graphics lies in the ability to transform and manipulate objects within cartesian coordinate systems, also known as spaces for brevity. Indeed, a fundamental concept that forms the backbone of many graphics pipelines is the transformation of 3D objects to various spaces in order to bring virtual worlds to be shown on the screen.

In [](transformations.md), we showed that to transform a vector we can transform the basis vectors representing the starting frame, so that we can express its coordinates with respect to a new space. Building upon this foundation, itâ€™s now interesting to look at the common spaces employed in the graphics pipeline and how to go from a space to another as well in order to project 3D scenes onto a 2D surface before showing the result on the screen. From the initial local space where objects originate, to the all-encompassing world space, and the camera space that offers a unique perspective, each space plays a crucial role in the intricate process of rendering.
