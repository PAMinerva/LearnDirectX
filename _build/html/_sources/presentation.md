# Welcome to Learn DirectX

This tutorial series will guides you through the use of the latest DirectX graphics API to create graphics applications in C++ from scratch, for Windows and Linux. Each tutorial will present a small sample to illustrate the theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

This series is designed for beginners with no prior knowledge of computer graphics or advanced mathematics. It use basic C++ and only require a basic understanding of high school math, such as algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.

The code base is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PAMinerva/LearnDirectX" target="_blank">here</a> (download both repositories to your local system).
