# Welcome to Learn DirectX

This tutorial series will guides you through the use of the latest DirectX graphics API to create 3D graphics applications in C++ from scratch, for Windows and Linux. Each tutorial will present a small code sample to illustrate the theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

This series is designed for beginners with no prior knowledge of computer graphics or advanced mathematics. It use basic C++ and only require a basic understanding of high school math, such as algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.

The entire code base is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/PAMinerva/LearnDirectX" target="_blank">here</a>.
