# Welcome to Learn DirectX from code samples

This tutorial series walks you through the use of the last DirectX graphics API to create 3D graphics applications in C++ from scratch, for Windows and Linux. Each tutorial will include a small demo or code sample to illustrate the theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

The tutorials are designed for beginners with no prior knowledge of computer graphics or advanced mathematics. They use basic C++ and only require a basic understanding of high school math, such as algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.

The code for all the tutorials is hosted on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/PAMinerva/LearnDirectX: https://github.com/PAMinerva/LearnDirectX" target="_blank">LearnDirectX</a>
